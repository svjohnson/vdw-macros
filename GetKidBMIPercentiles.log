==============================================================

Macro GetKidBMIPercentiles:

Creating a dataset "s.test_bmis", which will contain all BMI measures
on record for the people whose MRNs are contained in "s.test_kids" which
were taken while the people were between the ages of 2 and 17 and
taken between "01jan1960" and "10DEC2007".

The output dataset will contain a variable calculated by the CDCs
normative sample percentile score program found here:
http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/growthcharts/sas.htm

From this variable (called BMIPCT) you can categorize the children
into normal/overweight/obese brackets with the following format:

proc format
value bmipct
low -< 5    = 'Underweight < 5th percentile'
5   -< 85   = 'Normal weight 5th to 84.9th percentile'
85  -< 95   = 'Overweight 85th to 94.9th percentile'
95  -  high = 'Obese >=95th percentile'
