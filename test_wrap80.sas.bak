*The WRAP80 macro takes comments that are longer than 80 bytes and wraps them into
 the data set variable Result_Note which has a length of 80 bytes.  Additional observations
 are created as necessary.

*Since the maximum length for character variables = 32767 in any operating system this
 code will theoretically work for a comment variable with up to 16383 bytes storage;

*WRAP80 Macro Parameters ==>
  *  &readDS=data set that is being read and can be a permanent or temporary data set.
       This data set should have, at a minimum the variables ROWID, TYPE and COMMENT.
       COMMENT can be any length up to 16383 bytes.  It is assumed that the records are
       sorted by ROWID and TYPE with the COMMENTs in the desired order.
       COMMENT will be wrapped into RESULT_NOTE with 80 bytes of storage.  More records will
       be created as needed with breaks occurring at desired characters only.
       LINE, the fourth variable in the LAB_NOTES data set, will be calculated.
       This variable is a required positional parameter.

  *  &writeDS=data set being created and can be a permanent or temporary data set.
       This data set will contain ROWID, RESULT_NOTE, TYPE and LINE
       This variable is a required positional parameter.

  *  &addon_vars allows the user to keep additional site specific variables
       This variable is an optional positional parameter.;

 /*  &split_at=list of characters where split can occur in COMMENT to create Result_Note variable
       This variable is an optional keyword parameter and has a default value of blank . ; , ? and !
